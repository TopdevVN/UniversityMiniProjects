In this project, I will use knowledge about convolutional neural networks to train a self-driving car model using Keras. <br>
The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle in each frame. <br>
Udacity provided a simulator where I could steer a car around a track for data collection. <br>
I'll use those images data and steering angles to train a neural network, and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track. (There are two tracks) <br>
<br>
**Here are the video results:** <br>
