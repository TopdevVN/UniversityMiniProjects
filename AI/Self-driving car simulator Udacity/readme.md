In this project, I will use knowledge about convolutional neural networks to train a self-driving car model using Keras. 
The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle in each frame. 
Udacity provided a simulator where I could steer a car around a track for data collection. 
I'll use those images data and steering angles to train a neural network, and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track. (There are two tracks)
Here are the video results:
