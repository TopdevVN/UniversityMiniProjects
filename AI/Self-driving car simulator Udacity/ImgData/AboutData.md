Data used to train a self-driving car model using CNN. <br>
Data is collected by recording the process of driving a self-driving car using simulation software provided by Udacity. <br>
Total number of laps: 11 laps around map 1 (in simulation software). <br>
The data includes 33,270 photos taken from 3 cameras (left, right, and center), with 11,090 photos in each camera. <br>
There is also an additional driving_log file that records information about the path of the photos in real time for each frame at recording time. <br>
Each frame has additional information about four parameters of the simulated car:(steering_angle, throttle, break, and speed).
